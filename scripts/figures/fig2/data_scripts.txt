Data scripts for Figure 2
-------------------------
These should be run in sequence.


Model fitting on all ciliated cells with 4 mM KCl and 0 mM KCl:
    fitting/electrode_and_RC.py
    fitting/hyperpolarized.py
    fitting/hyperpolarized_p1.py
    fitting/hyperpolarized_GHK.py

Data preparation (on two folders: 4 mM KCl and 0 mM KCl):
    data_preparation/make_tables.py

Model comparison (4 mM KCl only):
    analysis/compare_hyperpolarized_fits.py

Selection (data from hyperpolarized.py, 4 mM KCl only):
    analysis/selection_hyperpolarized.py

Display of all fits (data from hyperpolarized.py, 4 mM KCl only):
    analysis/display_all_fits.py (choice 0 and 1)
